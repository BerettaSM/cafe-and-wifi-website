Nice place!
Pretty cool place.
I've been there before, loved it.
It's a calm cafe, pretty lovely.
The wifi signal there could use a boost.
The coffee could be cheaper.
10/10! Would visit again.
This place is always full, must be the lemon pie.
I'm planning to visit it soon.
The coffee is delicious.
Their croissant combo is amazing.
That's too far from where I live.
That's a great place.
The waiters are nice people.
Just left from this cafe, I'm stuffed!
